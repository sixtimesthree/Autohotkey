Just a repository where I keep my autohotkey scripts, mainly for work. 
Some are made by me, some borrowed and modified.
Many thanks to eveyone who has taken the time to develop and maintain Autohotkey over the years. It has been a huge timesaver for me. Hopefully I will be able to give back to the community once I become more proficient.
